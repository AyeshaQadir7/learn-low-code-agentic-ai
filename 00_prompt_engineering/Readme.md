# Prompt Engineering
A comprehensive guide and toolkit for mastering **Prompt Engineering** — the art and science of crafting effective prompts for AI models like GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, and others.  

## Overview

Prompt Engineering is a key skill in leveraging the full potential of large language models (LLMs). This repository provides practical examples, templates, best practices, and research-backed techniques for building powerful and reliable AI prompts.

Whether you're a **developer**, **researcher**, or **AI enthusiast**, this guide will help you:
- Design prompts that yield consistent, high-quality outputs.
- Use structured frameworks (e.g., **Chain-of-Thought**, **Few-Shot**, **ReAct**).
- Optimize prompts for different tasks like coding, writing, data extraction, and reasoning.
- Evaluate and improve model responses systematically.
